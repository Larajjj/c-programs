what is int main?
     C programs contain one or more functions, one of which must be main . 
     Every program in C begins executing at the function main . 
     Functions can return information. 
     The keyword int to the left of main indicates that main “returns” aninteger (whole-number) value.

#include <stdio.h>
void input (int*a,int*b)
{
        printf("Enter a");
        scanf("%d" ,a);
        printf("Enter b");
        scanf("%d" ,b);
}
int add (int a, int b)
{
        int c;
        c=a+b;
        return c;
}
void output (int a, int b, int c)
{
        printf("%d + %d is %d\n",a,b,c);
}
int main()
{
        int x,y,z;
        input(&x, &y);
        z=add(x,y);
